</p>
<p>
- L2CAP connection-oriented channels support (IP over BLE enabler)
</p>
<p>
- ACI_GAP_START_NAME_DISCOVERY_PROC command is deprecated
</p>

<p>
<b>802.15.4 general updates (Zigbee, Thread, MAC, PHY)</b>
</p>
<p>
- CCA (Clear Channel Assessment) Threshold has been increased
</p>

<p>
<b>Zigbee updates</b>
</p>
<p>
- 802_15_4 timer improvement solving several issues relative to the wraparound of this timer
</p>

<p>
<b>Thread updates</b>
</p>
<p>
- Fix wrapper issue with UDP receivers
</p>
<p>
- RCP build: improved commissioning process robustness
</p>

<p>
<b>MAC 802.15.4 updates</b>
</p>
<p>
- Fix unicast data processing after restart from persistence
</p>
<p>
- Fix wrong erratic PANID Compression Flag on Beacon Request
</p>
<p>
- Reduce MaxBe low level threshold allowing user to change CSMA-CA values
</p>

<p>
<b>BLE-Zigbee Concurrent mode</b>
</p>
<p>
- BLE-Zigbee static concurrent mode not supported in this release, will be fixed in the next release. Alternative is to use BLE-Zigbee Dynamic concurrent mode
</p>

<p>
<b>Safeboot</b>
</p>
<p>
- New binaries added: stm32wb5x_Safeboot_fw.bin, stm32wb3x_Safeboot_fw.bin, stm32wb1x_Safeboot_fw.bin.
</p>
<p>
- Safeboot is an independent part of the FUS that manages specifically one case: option bytes corruption.
</p>
<p>
- When option bytes are corrupted, the STM32WB hardware forces the boot to Safeboot whatever the running firmware.
</p>
<p>
- Safeboot is already present in the FUS and this image allows to update it. Refer to AN5185 for more details.
</p>
<p>
- Safeboot upgrade is optional.
