## Multilink example

This example implements a multilink communication between a STM32WB5MM-DK board and up to 8 smartphones through Bluetooth® LE. By creating simultaneous connection the board is able to transmit the same data to each smartphone. 

By using the ST BLE Sensor app on up to 8 smartphones, it is possible to access a user friendly interface to show the received data different ways such as textually, graph or dedicated panels.

If the dice panel is choosen on the application, it is possible to see a dice moving the same way on the application of each smartphone by moving the board or access the raw data sent by the different sensors on textual or graph mode.

The data generated by the board is organised on multiple services:

* accelerometer and gyroscope sensors

## Hardware Setup

### Board

The STM32WB5MM-DK is a complete development platform, based on Arm® Cortex®-M4 and Arm® Cortex®-M0+ cores, a multi protocol transceiver, various types of sensors and user interfaces (Push-buttons, Screen, Leds).

> Get the Firmware [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWB/tree/v1.13.1) and the process to load the wireless stack [here](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Connectivity:STM32WB_BLE_Hardware_Setup).

For this example the Bluetooth® Low Energy protocol is used.

>For more information about BLE please refer to the [STMicroelectronics BLE Wiki](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Connectivity:BLE_Overview)

### Sensors and user interfaces

The STM32WB5MM-DK embeed various sensors and user interfaces such as:

* Accelerometer
* Gyroscope
* Push-buttons
* LCD Screen

That are used in this example.

There is also:

* Temperature sensor
* Time of flight
* Digital microphone
* Gesture detection sensor
* RBG Leds

### Demonstration Cube

The cube model and Led setup is optionnal, but you can find the 3D files and Led configuration in this project.
